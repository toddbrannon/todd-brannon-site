          From a 16 year career as a tech in the operating room of three different hospitals, to a decade of working for three different healthcare organizations in supply chain and sourcing, I have found my way as a programmer and developer. 
          It was a scenic route to where I am today, but after much personal development, many online courses and a few successful freelance side-gigs, the future is bright. It all started when I discovered the possibilities with Excel VBA about 10 years ago.

          My first exposure to Excel macros was life changing on two counts. First, because it eliminated the need for this copy/paste report update method
          I was trained to use and fully automated the process. Second, it was the first time I realized what was possible with a few lines of code 
          and the possibilities looking ahead.

          Over the next few years, I would learn VBA and Python 
          development skills focused on eliminating non-value added manual steps for ongoing reporting and ETL processes. This development work would 
          often and notably reduce the cycle-times necessary for these processes from days to minutes and even seconds in some cases.

      Itâ€™s amazing to think back to 2009 when I left the clinical world for my first ever 
      analyst role that I barely knew how to use Outlook, much less Excel or Access. Today, I develop full stack applications, reporting and tools in Microsoft Excel, database applications in Microsoft Access, and innovative reports and dashboards in Microsoft Power BI.
